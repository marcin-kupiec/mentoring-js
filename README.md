## Development

First, install all dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Then, run tests to check if all requirements are met:
```
npm test
```

At first, all test will fail.
Go through the code and try to understand what is needed to be done.
Think about overall implementation and specific requirements.

You can implement each function separately - first try to implement append
function and make tests for this feature pass. Then move to the next feature.

If you are stuck, you can have a look at a branch
```
feat/single-lilnked-list-solution
```
to see how it can be implemented - but do not go there too soon. Give yourself
a chance to implement it without any help :)

Good luck! :)
